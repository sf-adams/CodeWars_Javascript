/* You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases. */

// My attempt
function likes(names) {
  if (names.length >= 4) {
    return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - 2} others like this`;
  } else if (names.length === 3) {
    return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
  } else if (names.length === 2) {
    return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
  } else if (names.length === 1) {
    return `${names[0]} likes this`;
  } else {
    return "no one likes this";
  }
}

console.log(likes([]));
console.log(likes(["Peter"]));
console.log(likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]));
console.log(likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]));
console.log(likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max", "Benjamin", "Cameron"]));

// Solution using switch
function likesSwitch(names) {
  names = names || [];
  switch (names.length) {
    case 0:
      return "no one likes this";
      break;
    case 1:
      return names[0] + " likes this";
      break;
    case 2:
      return names[0] + " and " + names[1] + " like this";
      break;
    case 3:
      return names[0] + ", " + names[1] + " and " + names[2] + " like this";
      break;
    default:
      return (
        names[0] +
        ", " +
        names[1] +
        " and " +
        (names.length - 2) +
        " others like this"
      );
  }
}

// Genius solution

// Returning an object, the value of which is determined by using the Math.min() function to choose the smaller of 4 and the length of the array
function likes(names) {
  return {
    0: "no one likes this",
    1: `${names[0]} likes this`,
    2: `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`,
    3: `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`,
    4: `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - 2} others like this`,
  }[Math.min(4, names.length)];
}
