# JavaScript Challenges

Over time, the system for solving these has evolved, and now a TDD approach is used in the form of Jest, so that the tests can be run in VSCode before any need for the tests in CodeWars.

### Conventional Commits

This repository has been used to experiment with the **Conventional Commits** method. As described [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), these are a _specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages_.

For the purpose of documenting progress in the challenges, the following types have been used (inspired by the [Angular Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)):

- **docs**: updating the README or the md files for each challenge
- **test**: the initial tests have been set up for the challenge
- **feat**: completion of the challenge so that all the tests pass
- **refactor**: refining the solution so that it uses fewer lines, or is more powerful
- **perf**: the `Best Practice` and `Clever` solutions have been added at the bottom for reference

The normal structure for these messages is as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
