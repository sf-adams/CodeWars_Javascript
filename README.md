# JavaScript Challenges

> _Learning new things about JS by solving one kata each day_

Over time, the system for solving these has evolved, and now Jest has been added to facilitate a TDD approach. In this way, tests can be run in VSCode before any need for the tests on the site.

Solution files have also been added to dissect some of the _best practices_ or _cleverest_ submissions.

## Conventional Commits

This repository has been used to experiment with the **Conventional Commits** method. As described [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), these are a _specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages_.

For the purpose of documenting progress in the challenges, the following types have been used (inspired by the [Angular Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)):

- **docs**: updating the README or the md files for each challenge
- **test**: the initial tests have been set up for the challenge
- **feat**: completion of the challenge so that all the tests pass
- **refactor**: refining the solution so that it uses fewer lines, or is more powerful
- **perf**: the `Best Practice` and `Clever` solutions have been added at the bottom for reference

The normal structure for these messages is as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
